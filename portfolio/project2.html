            <h2>PROJECT TYPE</h2>
            <p>University Project - Unity, C#</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Math Games is an MR and PC game developed using Unity that is aimed at helping teachers and students to both teach and learn the more basic math concepts for those in middle school and similar ages. During the development of this project, we worked with a client who was a math professor to make sure that the project aligned with their needs and wants for the product. Rather than having complete freedom on what we wanted from this project it required us to learn how to work with external clients and work through compromises on both ends.</p>

            <h2>Features Developed by Me</h2>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>3D Maze Puzzle</h3>
                <img src="../media/images/MathPuzzles_3DMaze.png" alt="3D Maze">
                <p>Developed a challenging 3D maze puzzle that integrates mathematical concepts into gameplay. Players navigate through 3D floating puzzles, requiring the knowledge and application of movement along the 3D axis.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Menu System</h3>
                <img src="../media/images/MathPuzzles_MainMenu.png" alt="Menu System">
                <p>Created an intuitive menu system that enhances user experience and navigation within the game. This system includes options for settings and levels, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for players.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Flashlight Puzzle</h3>
                <img src="../media/images/MathPuzzles_FlashLightPuzzle.png" alt="Flashlight Puzzle">
                <p>Designed an engaging flashlight puzzle mechanic where players use light to look through a cube to collect the right object for the current hole. When a user picks up a shape, they can put it onto the dropper and resize it, which incorporates the math concept of 2D dimensions for various shapes, including circles, cubes, and triangles.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>World/Level Design for PC</h3>
                <img src="../media/images/MathPuzzles_Environment.png" alt="Environment">
                <p>Crafted captivating and visually appealing world and level designs that complement the gameplay mechanics. Each level presents unique challenges and puzzles, encouraging players to apply mathematical reasoning in diverse environments.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Rose Logic</h3>
                <img src="../media/images/MathPuzzles_RoseLogic.png" alt="Rose Logic">
                <p>Implemented rose logic, which goes with the back story of the game from the story "The Little Prince". The rose is used to symbolise and represent how many puzzles the player has completed and gives the player a clear goal of completing the rose. When the player completes a puzzle, and effect occurs, which gives them a new petal.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Sound System</h3>
                <img src="../media/images/MathPuzzles_FoxLogic.png" alt="Sound System">
                <p>Engineered a dynamic sound system that enhances immersion and gameplay experience. This system includes ambient sounds, puzzle-solving cues, and interactive audio elements, enriching the overall atmosphere of the game. WIth the help of Milad we also introduced a Fox system which talks to the player and gives them quick insight on what to do.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Game Logic</h3>
                <p>Developed the core game logic that governs puzzle mechanics, player interactions, and progression. This includes implementing mathematical rules and algorithms to ensure challenging yet rewarding gameplay experiences for players.</p>
