            <h2>PROJECT TYPE</h2>
            <p>University Project - C, OpenGL</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A small demo game used to mimic a billiards game. This was our first game development project we did in university and is a single-player game that follows the standard rules of Billiard, allowing players to use and aim a cue to shoot the balls on the table. This project was our first game-related project and required us to figure out and implement semi-realistic physics so that the game would produce expected and realistic outcomes when shooting and hitting the balls.</p>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Ball Class/Algorithm</h3>
                <img src="../media/images/Billiards_Gameplay.png" alt="Ball Feature">
                <ul>
                    <li>Ball Physics: Designed and implemented a class to handle the properties and behaviors of billiard balls, including position, velocity, and collision detection.</li>
                    <li>Collision Checks: Developed algorithms for checking for collisions between ball-ball and ball-wall.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Stick Algorithm</h3>
                <img src="../media/images/Billiards_ScoreTracking.png" alt="Stick Feature">
                <ul>
                    <li>Aiming Mechanism: Co-developed the algorithm for the stick's aiming mechanism, allowing players to precisely control the direction and force of their shots.</li>
                    <li>Force Application: Implemented the logic for applying force to the cue ball, factoring in the angle and power of the shot to produce realistic ball trajectories.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Stick Class</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Class Design: Created a class to encapsulate the properties and behaviors of the billiard stick, including position, rotation, and user input handling.</li>
                    <li>Rendering: Implemented the rendering of the stick using legacy OpenGL, ensuring it visually aligns with the player's aim and interactions.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Game Loop/Logic</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Game Logic Integration: Co-developed the main game loop, integrating all game components, including ball physics, stick mechanics, and collision detection.</li>
                    <li>Frame Management: Ensured smooth gameplay by managing frame updates, rendering cycles, and user inputs effectively within the main game loop.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
